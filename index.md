I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/puremath_en/) in 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Fuxi Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/zhangfxi/eindex.htm) and [Prof. Xinyi Li](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~xinyili/). I obtained my B.S. from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) in 2017.
- My main research interest is probability theory, with focuses on Percolation, Gaussian free field, and Brownian loop soup.
